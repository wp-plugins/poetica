An alternative text editor that enables realtime collaborative writing and
editing of posts within WordPress.

== Description ==

Poetica is an alternative to WordPress's default text editing interface,
TinyMCE. It uses cutting edge technology to allow people to work together, at
the same time on WordPress drafts. It's like having your own Google Docs inside
WordPress!

* Use Poetica's tracked changes to edit your work. Poetica has an easy to understand visual interface so you can tell who's changed what in WordPress.
* No more getting locked out of posts. Make sure the right people - inside or outside your core team - can access what they need, when they need it.
* No more copy and paste. Use WordPress as your writing, editing, formatting and publishing platform.
